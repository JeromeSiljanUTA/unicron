Lets me make changes to my org-agenda and have my iCalenar synced from an HTTP GET request.

This is useful for when I make changes to my org-agenda from my phone and want to have my calendar updated as well.

** Install
#+NAME: Install and run the server
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker compose up -d --build
#+END_SRC
